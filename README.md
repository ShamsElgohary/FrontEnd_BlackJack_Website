# Software Web Project Description
“BlackJack” is an E-commerce online website that allows users to buy or sell products over the internet, the system provides users with different categories to check out! The system allows users who are looking for something specific to simply use the search bar instead. Also, it allows users to view and browse all products on the site, users can also write their reviews on different products, The system allows the seller to use a dashboard which is used to add products, so seller can identify the amount of a certain product the seller wishes to sell and also to observe how many products are left in stock and selecting its price. The buyer can add any product he needs in his wishlist or add it to cart to be bought. Any user can contact site owner if he faced any problems or issues with the site.
